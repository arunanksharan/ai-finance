# Module 1.2: Hedge Fund Basics

## Week 1: Hedge Fund Structure and Strategies

### Day 1-2: Hedge Fund Business Models

#### Definition and History

**Origins with Alfred Winslow Jones**

- Created the first hedge fund in 1949
- Pioneered the long/short equity model
- Introduced the performance fee structure
- Used leverage to enhance returns
- Established the limited partnership structure

**Evolution to Modern Hedge Funds**

- 1960s-70s: Early pioneers like George Soros and Julian Robertson
- 1980s-90s: Expansion beyond equity long/short to fixed income, macro, etc.
- 2000s: Institutional adoption and growth in assets
- 2008: Financial crisis impact and increased regulation
- 2010s-Present: Growth of quant strategies, alternative data, and machine learning

**Key Defining Features of Hedge Funds**

- Private investment vehicles (not public like mutual funds)
- Flexible investment mandates
- Performance-based compensation structure
- Limited or restricted redemption terms
- Historically less regulated than traditional asset managers

#### Legal Structures

**Limited Partnerships (LP)**

- Common structure in the US
- General Partner (GP): Fund manager with unlimited liability
- Limited Partners (LPs): Investors with liability limited to investment
- Pass-through taxation (no entity-level tax)
- Governed by partnership agreement

**Offshore Entities**

- Typically incorporated in tax-neutral jurisdictions (Cayman Islands, BVI, etc.)
- Benefits non-US investors and tax-exempt US investors (avoiding UBTI)
- Often structured as corporations
- Separate and parallel to onshore funds
- Subject to local regulations in domicile jurisdiction

**Master-Feeder Structures**

- Master fund: Trading entity holding all positions
- Onshore feeder: US taxable investors
- Offshore feeder: Non-US and US tax-exempt investors
- Benefits: Operational efficiency, single portfolio
- Regulatory considerations: Different reporting requirements

**Other Structures**

- Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)
- Series LLCs (for multiple strategies)
- UCITS (European regulated structure)
- Mini-master structures
- Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)

#### Fee Structures

**Management Fees**

- Typically 1-2% of assets under management (AUM)
- Calculated and paid quarterly or monthly
- Covers operational expenses, salaries, research costs
- Often includes fee breaks for larger investments
- Trend toward lower management fees in recent years

**Performance Fees**

- Typically 20% of profits (can range from 10-30%)
- Aligns manager and investor interests
- Usually calculated annually, sometimes quarterly
- Subject to high water mark (and sometimes hurdle rate)
- May include crystallization provisions

**High Water Marks**

- Prevents managers from earning performance fees on the same gains twice
- Previous peak NAV that must be exceeded before earning new performance fees
- Resets only when exceeding previous high
- May include "reset" provisions after extended periods below high water mark
- Important investor protection mechanism

**Hurdle Rates**

- Minimum return threshold before performance fee applies
- Can be fixed rate (e.g., 5%) or floating (e.g., LIBOR + 2%)
- "Hard hurdle" vs. "soft hurdle" mechanisms
- Less common in equity-focused strategies
- More common in credit and fixed income strategies

**Variations and Trends**

```
Jan 2022: +2.1%
Feb 2022: -1.5%
Mar 2022: +3.2%
Apr 2022: +0.8%
May 2022: -2.4%
Jun 2022: -3.1%
Jul 2022: +4.5%
Aug 2022: +1.9%
Sep 2022: -0.7%
Oct 2022: +2.8%
Nov 2022: +1.2%
Dec 2022: -1.0%

Jan 2023: +3.5%
Feb 2023: +2.0%
Mar 2023: -1.8%
Apr 2023: +0.5%
May 2023: +1.7%
Jun 2023: +2.3%
Jul 2023: -0.9%
Aug 2023: -2.1%
Sep 2023: +3.0%
Oct 2023: +1.1%
Nov 2023: +2.6%
Dec 2023: +0.4%
```

Assume the S&P 500 returned +9.5% in 2022 and +15.2% in 2023, with an annualized volatility of 15.8%.
Assume the risk-free rate is 2.0% for the period.

Calculate:

1. Annual returns for 2022 and 2023
2. Annualized volatility
3. Maximum drawdown
4. Sharpe ratio
5. Beta to the S&P 500 (assume a beta of 0.35)
6. Alpha (based on CAPM)

Interpret these results in the context of hedge fund performance evaluation.
