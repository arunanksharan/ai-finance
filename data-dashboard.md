Below is a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Market Data Dashboard. This tool will be developed using a Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components, a FastAPI backend, and a self‑hosted PostgreSQL database. The MVP will pull live market data from free/open‑source APIs.

Market Data Dashboard PRD

1. Overview

The Market Data Dashboard is an educational tool designed to reinforce the Financial Markets Fundamentals module by visualizing real‑time market metrics. It displays data for multiple asset classes (equities, fixed income, derivatives, currencies, commodities), shows key market indicators, and visualizes market microstructure elements such as order types and bid‑ask spreads.

Key Objectives:
• Educate users on market structure, asset classes, and microstructure.
• Provide interactive visualizations for live market metrics.
• Use free/open‑source market data APIs for MVP data ingestion.
• Persist historical data for trend analysis using PostgreSQL.

⸻

2. Key Features

2.1 Live Data Display
• Asset Classes: Visualize data for equities, fixed income, derivatives, currencies, and commodities.
• Market Indicators: Display key metrics (e.g., indices, bid‑ask spreads, trading volumes, order types).
• Economic Data: Present fundamental economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, interest rates) if available.

2.2 Interactive Visualizations
• Charts & Graphs: Use interactive charts (e.g., line charts for price trends, bar charts for volumes) to display asset data.
• Filters: Allow users to filter by asset class and time range.
• Responsive UI: Ensure the dashboard is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

2.3 Data Persistence
• Historical Data Storage: Save fetched market data into a self‑hosted PostgreSQL database for historical tracking.
• User Settings: Optionally, persist user preferences for customized views (if user accounts are implemented).

2.4 Data Ingestion & Refresh
• API Integration: Periodically fetch market data from free sources.
• Background Scheduler: Use a scheduled process to refresh and store data.

3. Data Sources (Free/Open‑Source)

For the MVP, the following free APIs will be used:
• Alpha Vantage: Provides free access to stock, forex, and crypto market data (requires a free API key).
https://www.alphavantage.co/
• Finnhub: Offers a free tier for equities, forex, and crypto data.
https://finnhub.io/
• Yahoo Finance (Unofficial): Can be used via open‑source libraries (e.g., yfinance) as an alternative or backup.

4. User Stories 1. US1 – Dashboard Viewing:
   As a finance student, I want to view a dashboard that displays live market data for multiple asset classes so that I can understand the dynamics of financial markets. 2. US2 – Interactive Filtering:
   As a learner, I want to filter the dashboard by asset class and time range so that I can focus on specific market segments relevant to my studies. 3. US3 – Visual Data Interpretation:
   As a user, I want interactive charts that show key market metrics (e.g., bid‑ask spreads, trading volumes) so that I can visualize market microstructure and trends. 4. US4 – Historical Data Analysis (Admin):
   As an admin, I want historical market data to be stored in PostgreSQL so that I can analyze trends over time and troubleshoot data ingestion issues.

5. Technical Architecture

5.1 Frontend
• Framework: Next.js
• Styling: Tailwind CSS integrated with shadcn UI components
• Components:
• Dashboard Page: Displays a summary of market data with interactive charts.
• Filter Components: Allow users to select asset classes and time ranges.
• Data Visualization: Integrate with a charting library (e.g., Plotly.js or Chart.js) for dynamic graphs.
• Routing: Next.js routing for clean URL paths (e.g., /dashboard).

5.2 Backend
• Framework: FastAPI
• Endpoints:
• GET /api/market-data: Returns aggregated live and historical market data from PostgreSQL.
• POST /api/refresh: Triggers a manual refresh of market data (optional, mainly for testing).
• Data Processing:
• API routes will call data ingestion functions that fetch data from free APIs and update the PostgreSQL database.
• Documentation: Auto-generated Swagger UI for API documentation via FastAPI.

5.3 Database
• Platform: Self‑hosted PostgreSQL
• Schema:
• Assets Table: Stores asset identifiers, asset class, and current market data.
• Historical Data Table: Logs timestamped market data records.
• User Preferences (Optional): For storing dashboard settings and preferences.

5.4 Data Ingestion & Scheduler
• Background Process:
• A scheduled task (e.g., using Celery or an external cron job) that periodically pulls data from Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, and/or Yahoo Finance.
• Update the PostgreSQL database with the latest market data.
• Security:
• Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables).

⸻

6. Integration & Deployment
   • Frontend Deployment:
   • Next.js app deployed on a Node.js server (Vercel, DigitalOcean, etc.).
   • Backend Deployment:
   • FastAPI app deployed on a server or containerized (Docker) and served behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
   • Database Deployment:
   • Self‑hosted PostgreSQL on a secure server with proper backups and security configurations.
   • Communication:
   • Frontend calls FastAPI endpoints via HTTPS.

⸻

7. Testing & Quality Assurance
   • Unit Tests:
   • FastAPI endpoints with pytest.
   • Next.js component tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
   • Integration Tests:
   • End‑to‑end tests to verify data flows from the external API to the dashboard.
   • Responsive Testing:
   • Cross‑browser testing to ensure responsive design on various devices.
